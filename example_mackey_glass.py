LEARNING THE MACKEY GLASS
Small example of how to use the Echo State Network class given in the package.
We feed the esn with a common time delay signal called the Mackey glass: 
(Leon Glass and Michael Mackey (2010) 
href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mackey-Glass_equation"
(See also the header of the mackey_glass.txt file)
After the training process, the echo state network predicts the continuation
of the signal. The program prints the training mean squared error in the 
terminal and displays two figures: one with a plot of the mackey glass data
and another one with the prediction made by the esn.
