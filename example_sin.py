LEARNING THE MACKEY GLASS
Small example of how to use the Echo State Network class given in the package.
We feed the esn with a simple sinusoidal signal. 
 After the training process, the echo state network predicts the continuation
 of the sinus. The program displays two figures: one with a plot of 
 the sinus data used for training and another one with the prediction.
